<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Animal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure Controlled Ventilator</li><li>Volume Controlled Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The small animal ventilator market features two primary types: pressure-controlled and volume-controlled ventilators. Pressure-controlled ventilators regulate airflow based on a preset pressure limit, ensuring safe ventilation even with varying lung compliance. In contrast, volume-controlled ventilators deliver a specific volume of air with each breath, regardless of the pressure required to achieve that volume. Both types play crucial roles in veterinary care, allowing precise management of respiratory needs in small animals during surgeries or critical care situations.</p></p>
