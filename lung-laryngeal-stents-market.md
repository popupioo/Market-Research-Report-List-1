<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lung Laryngeal Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-expandable Stents</li><li>Balloon-expandable Stents</li><li>Non-expandable Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lung laryngeal stents market comprises three main types: self-expandable stents, balloon-expandable stents, and non-expandable stents. Self-expandable stents automatically expand to fit the airway, providing consistent support. Balloon-expandable stents require inflation via a balloon to achieve the desired diameter, offering controlled sizing. Non-expandable stents maintain a fixed size and are typically used for temporary support. Each type serves distinct clinical needs, aiding in the management of airway obstructions and improving patient outcomes.</p></p>
