<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The GS CMOS Image Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Front-Illuminated Structure</li><li>Back-Illuminated Structure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The GS CMOS image sensor market is divided into two main types: front-illuminated and back-illuminated structures. Front-illuminated sensors feature a design where light must pass through wiring and circuitry before reaching the photodiodes, resulting in lower sensitivity. In contrast, back-illuminated sensors position the photodiodes on the light-receiving side, enhancing light capture and overall image quality, especially in low-light conditions. This distinction affects performance, applications, and adoption rates in various sectors, including consumer electronics and automotive imaging technologies.</p></p>
