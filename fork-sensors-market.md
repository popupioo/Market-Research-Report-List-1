<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fork Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PNP-NO</li><li>PNP-NC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fork sensors are vital in automation for detecting the presence of objects in various industrial applications. The PNP-NO (Normally Open) type activates an output when the object is detected, allowing current to flow, ideal for sensing applications that require triggered responses. Conversely, the PNP-NC (Normally Closed) type maintains output until an object is sensed, stopping the current flow; this is useful for safety applications where interruption of the signal indicates an issue. Both types enhance efficiency and safety in operations.</p></p>
