<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist Coating</li><li>Negative Photoresist Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The photoresist coating market is primarily divided into two types: positive and negative photoresist coatings. Positive photoresist coatings are characterized by their ability to become soluble when exposed to light, allowing for detailed pattern transfer on substrates. Conversely, negative photoresist coatings become insoluble upon exposure to light, resulting in the unexposed areas being washed away. Both types are crucial in microfabrication processes, such as semiconductor manufacturing and printed circuit board production, enabling precision in various electronic applications.</p></p>
