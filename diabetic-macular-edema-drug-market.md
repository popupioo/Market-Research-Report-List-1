<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diabetic Macular Edema Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intravitreal Injections</li><li>Intravitreal Implants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The diabetic macular edema drug market primarily includes intravitreal injections and intravitreal implants. Intravitreal injections involve administering medication directly into the vitreous cavity of the eye, offering rapid therapeutic effects for managing edema. Commonly used drugs for this method include anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents and corticosteroids. In contrast, intravitreal implants are devices that release medication slowly over time, providing sustained treatment and reducing the frequency of injections. Both approaches aim to combat retinal swelling and preserve vision.</p></p>
