<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acrylic Fibers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spinning Acrylic Fibers</li><li>Dry Spinning Acrylic Fibers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The acrylic fibers market is primarily divided into two types based on the spinning process: wet spinning and dry spinning. Wet spinning involves dissolving acrylic polymer in a solvent and extruding it into a coagulation bath, resulting in strong, durable fibers suitable for textiles. Dry spinning, on the other hand, involves dissolving the polymer in a volatile solvent, which is evaporated during fiber formation. This method typically produces softer and finer fibers, making them ideal for lightweight fabrics and specialty applications.</p></p>
