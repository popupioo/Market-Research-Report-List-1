<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wall Hung Combination Boilers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Condensing</li><li>Non-Condensing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Wall Hung Combination Boilers market primarily consists of two types: condensing and non-condensing. Condensing boilers maximize energy efficiency by capturing and reusing heat from exhaust gases, resulting in lower fuel consumption and reduced emissions. In contrast, non-condensing boilers operate at higher temperatures and discharge exhaust without recovering energy, making them less efficient. While condensing boilers are increasingly favored for their environmental benefits and cost savings, non-condensing options remain in use due to lower initial costs and simpler installation requirements.</p></p>
