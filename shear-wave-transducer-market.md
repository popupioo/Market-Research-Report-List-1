<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shear Wave Transducer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normal Incidence Sensor</li><li>Radial Incidence Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The shear wave transducer market features two main types: normal incidence sensors and radial incidence sensors. Normal incidence sensors detect shear waves at a 90-degree angle to the surface, making them suitable for applications in structural integrity testing. In contrast, radial incidence sensors are designed to detect shear waves at an angle, which allows for enhanced sensitivity in certain materials and geometries. Both types serve critical roles in non-destructive testing, offering precise measurements for quality assurance and evaluation.</p></p>
